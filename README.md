Spherical Harmonic Equation Sheet show the equations in spherical coordinates used to model spherical harmonics. Phi is from 0 to pi and theta is from 0 to 2pi.

Spherical Harmonic Plot table shows the basic spherical harmonics with coefficient 1

Run plot_sph_harm.py with coeffic_to_plot.py to model spherical harmonic linear combinations. Format CSV file to el,m,alpha \n "el value","m value","coefficient value"

Volume Integration Code.nb is mathematica code used to take the volume integral of spherical harmonics and linear combinations of spherical harmonics.
